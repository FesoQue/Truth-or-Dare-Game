## The Project
The rules of this game is pretty simple, you present someone with two options: TRUTH or DARE and they get to choose.

Truth means you ask someone any question and they get to answer honestly.

Dare means you give someone something to do, to take action on.

The play Buttons will randomly generate truth or dare questions to the players.
